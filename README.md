# Table for Juan 

## About the Project

Table for Juan is a fast, healthy, and affordable Filipino meal delivery service. The project is designed to cater to the fast-paced life of today's generation while offering a touch of nostalgia with each meal. Our goal is to bring homely, authentic Filipino meals to your doorstep, ensuring they are as delicious and nutritious as if you've just eaten at your own dining table.

Our menu includes a variety of Filipino dishes such as Fried Bangus, Menudo, Nilaga, Ginisang Sayote, Pork Sinigang, Pork Humba, Bean Stew, Beef Broccoli, and Beef in Mushroom Sauce. We prioritize using high-quality ingredients from reputable brands, served hot and fresh.

Located in Kassel Residences, Paranaque City, we operate from Monday to Friday, offering only takeaway and delivery services.
